<h1>Lucky Survivor - Missing Images</h1>
<a href="index.html">Main</a>
<h2>Missing? Why? Where were they last seen?</h2>
<p>The game has events which should display gloriously sexy images, but does not. The reason being that a fitting image has not been found, yet. Missing images are listed below (a better description of what the images are supposed to show is in the works). If you have images that at least vaguely fit what's needed and you could send them to us ... that would be great!</p>
A few guidelines for what we are and are not looking for:
<dl>
<dd><b>2D</b></dd>
<dt>Beggars can't be choosers, so there will be a wide variety of art styles in the images you see in the game, but no 3D (CGI or real) images, please (exceptions might be made for background images).</dt>
<dd><b>No need to be perfect</b></dd>
<dt>If it's in the list below, right now there is no image whatsoever in the game. So an image that vaguely fits what's needed is better than no image at all.</dt>
<dd><b>"Some assembly required" is OK</b></dd>
<dt>While none of us is a graphics artist, some basic image manipulation skill is present, so if your image requires some work (e.g. background removal, decensoring), it's still a viable candidate</dt>
<dd><b>Bigger is better</b></dd>
<dt>Please send the highest-resolution/least compressed (lossless compression is OK, obviously) version of an image you have. Not only does it look better in the game, it makes image manipulations (if needed) easier.</dt>
<dd><b>Let the game do the compositing</b></dd>
<dt>If you do any image manipulations yourself, please keep in mind, that the game can "soft" composite images. Even if the image description has multiple parts, we can always break one image into multiple images. Example: for the event we want to show girl A and girl B at the beach. Instead of "shopping" girl A and girl B on the beach background and sending us the result, "just" send us the "girl A" and "girl B" images (with transparent backgrounds). we can then reuse the images in other locations, or add alternative images for the girls, so sometimes they are shown with a bikini and sometimes they are shown with a one piece. Or we later decide to add a third girl and just want to rearrange girl A and girl B a little.</dt>
