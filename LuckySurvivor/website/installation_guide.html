<h1>Lucky Survivor - Installation Guide</h1>
<a href="index.html">Main</a>
<h2>Install Java 7</h2>
More precisely the Java 7 SE Development Kit. The game will run with the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), but some modding features will only work with the JDK. Since both are free and the JDK includes the JRE it is recommended to only install the JDK.
<dl>
<dt><b>The JDK installation routine is asking me, if i want to install a "Public JRE". Do i want that?</b></dt>
<dd>If you use Java only for LuckySurvivor, the answer is: No! The JDK comes with a "private" JRE and that's the one you want to use for LuckySuvivor. The public JRE is easier to use, it will "hook" into windows, so a simple double-click on a .jar file will start it, but some modding features of the game will not available with this JRE. You can still install the public JRE, if you want to, but make sure to start the game with private JRE.</dd>

<h2>Get the game executable</h2>
This is <b>one</b> .jar file named <b>LuckySurvivor-XY.jar</b>. New versions of the game are released quite frequently, but the file size is less than 1 MB.
<h2>Get the game content.</h2>
The game content (texts and images) is release incrementally so you will need <b>all</b> the .zip files. So when new content is released, you only need to download the new content and not re-download the content you already have.
<h2>Put .jar file and .zip files in one directory.</h2>
<b>Don't</b> unzip the .zip files manually. The game will do it for you and if you don't do it right, the game might not work correctly.
<h2>Start the game</h2>
Open a shell/command prompt, change to the directory where you put the game and type <b><code>&lt;path_to_your_jdk_java_executable&gt; -jar LuckySurvivor-XY.jar</code></b> (replace the LuckySurvivor-XY.jar part with the actual name of your .jar file, of course).
<dl>
<dt><b>What's the path to my "jdk_java_executable"?</b></dt>
<dd>Probably something like "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_17\jre\bin\java.exe". You also might have a public JRE installed in a path like "C:\Program Files\Java\jre\bin\java.exe". If you want ALL the features, DON'T use the public JRE!</dd>
<dt><b>Where can i find the command prompt?</b></dt>
<dd>That depends on your operating system. On Windows XP: 1.open your start menu 2. click the run option 3. enter "cmd" in the dialog box that opens and click "OK". On newer Windows versions legend has it that you can type "cmd" in the search window.</dd>
<dt><b>When i try to start the game, i get the error "Error: Could not find or load main class main.Main"</b></dt>
<dd>You might not be in the right directory. You have to be in the same directory as the .jar file.</dd>
<dt><b>How do i change to another directory?</b></dt>
<dd><code>cd</code> e.g. <code>cd "C:\Games\LuckySurvivor"</code>. The quotation marks are necessary, if the path contains blanks.</dd>
<dt><b>When i try to start the game, i get a lengthy error message that starts with "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: main/Main : Unsupported major.minor version 51.0"</b></dt>
<dd>Your Java installation is too old. You need at least Java 7 SE. Note: It is possible to have multiple versions of Java installed in parallel, so even if you have Java 7 SE installed, you must make sure the you are using the right version. Either deinstall the older versions or make sure that you specify the full path to your Java 7 executable when starting the game.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>The game does not start! Halp!</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b>If you are upgrading from an earlier version of the game</b></dt>
<dd>Try deleting the "config" directory that the game has previously created. You may lose some custom settings, e.g. key mappings, but sometimes the format of the config files changes and the game will choke on old config files. Deleting the "config" directory is the easiest way to eliminate old config files as the source of the error.</dd>
