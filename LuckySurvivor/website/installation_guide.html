<h1>Lucky Survivor - Installation Guide</h1>
<a href="index.html">Main</a>
<h2>Install Java 7</h2>
More precisely the Java 7 SE Development Kit. The game will run with the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), but some modding features will only work with the JDK. Since both are free and the JDK includes the JRE it is recommended to only install the JDK
<h2>Get the game executable</h2>
This is <b>one</b> .jar file named <b>LuckySurvivor-XY.jar</b>. New versions of the game are released quite frequently, but the file size is less than 1 MB.
<h2>Get the game content.</h2>
The game content (texts and images) is release incrementally so you will need <b>all</b> the .zip files. So when new content is released, you only need to download the new content and not re-download the content you already have.
<h2>Put .jar file and .zip files in one directory.</h2>
<b>Don't</b> unzip the .zip files manually. The game will do it for you and if you don't do it right, the game might not work correctly.
<h2>Start the game</h2>
Open a shell/command prompt, change to the directory where you put the game and type <b><code>java -classpath LuckySurvivor-XY.jar:mod/events/bin main.Main</code></b> (replace the LuckySurvivor-XY.jar part with the actual name of your .jar file, of course)

<dt><b>Where can i find the command prompt?</b></dt>
<dd>That depends on your operating system. On Windows XP: 1.open your start menu 2. click the run option 3. enter "cmd" in the dialog box that opens and click "OK". On newer Windows versions legend has it that you can type "cmd" in the search window.</dd>
