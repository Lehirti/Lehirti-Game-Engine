<h1>Lucky Survivor - Installation Guide</h1>
<a href="index.html">Main</a>
<h2>Install Java 7</h2>
More precisely the Java 7 SE Development Kit. The game will run with the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), but some modding features will only work with the JDK. Since both are free and the JDK includes the JRE it is recommended to only install the JDK
<h2>Get the game executable</h2>
This is <b>one</b> .jar file named <b>LuckySurvivor-XY.jar</b>. New versions of the game are released quite frequently, but the file size is less than 1 MB.
<h2>Get the game content.</h2>
The game content (texts and images) is release incrementally so you will need <b>all</b> the .zip files. So when new content is released, you only need to download the new content and not re-download the content you already have.
<h2>Put .jar file and .zip files in one directory.</h2>
<b>Don't</b> unzip the .zip files manually. The game will do it for you and if you don't do it right, the game might not work correctly.
<h2>Start the game</h2>
Open a shell/command prompt, change to the directory where you put the game and type <b><code>java -classpath mod/events/bin:LuckySurvivor-XY.jar main.Main</code></b> (replace the LuckySurvivor-XY.jar part with the actual name of your .jar file, of course)
<dl>
<dt><b>Where can i find the command prompt?</b></dt>
<dd>That depends on your operating system. On Windows XP: 1.open your start menu 2. click the run option 3. enter "cmd" in the dialog box that opens and click "OK". On newer Windows versions legend has it that you can type "cmd" in the search window.</dd>
<dt><b>When i try to start the game, i get the error "Error: Could not find or load main class main.Main"</b></dt>
<dd>You might not be in the right directory. You have to be in the same directory as the .jar file.</dd>
<dt><b>How do i change to another direcotry?</b></dt>
<dd><code>cd</code> e.g. <code>cd "C:\Games\LuckySurvivor"</code>. The quotation marks are necessary, if the path contains blanks.</dd>
<dt><b>When i try to start the game, i get a lengthy error message that starts with "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: main/Main : Unsupported major.minor version 51.0"</b></dt>
<dd>Your Java installation is too old. You need at least Java 7 SE. Note: It is possible to have multiple versions of Java installed in parallel, so even if you have Java 7 SE installed, you must make sure the you are using the right version. Either deinstall the older versions or change the command like this <code><b>"C:\Program Files\Java\JDK7\jre\bin\java"</b> -classpath mod/events/bin:LuckySurvivor-XY.jar main.Main</code> to specify which of the installed java versions you want to use.</dd>
