<h2>What you get</h2>
<i>-- I'll cum deep inside you and make you pregnant!</i>
<ul>
<li>A simple, but working game engine</li>
<li>An intro and a couple of unfinished events</li>
</ul>
So if all you want is to play a hentai game, then "this is not the hentai game you are looking for", yet. If - on the other
hand - <a href="modders_guide.html"><b>you would like to participate in creating a hentai game</b></a>, even if it's only some small event or a small story you would like to tell then you have come to the right place.
<h2>How to get started</h2>
<i>-- Please put your… That! Your ponos! Here! …My vagoo. And J… J… JAM IT IN!</i>
<ol>
<li><b>Install Java 7.</b> More precisely the Java 7 SE Development Kit. The game will run with the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), but some modding features will only work with the JDK. Since both are free and the JDK includes the JRE it is recommended to only install the JDK.</li>
<li><b>Get the game executable.</b> This is <b>one</b> .jar file named <b>LuckySurvivor-XY.jar</b>. New versions of the game are released quite frequently, but the file size is less than 1 MB.</li>
<li><b>Get the game content.</b> The game content (texts and images) is release incrementally so you will need <b>all</b> the .zip files. So when new content is released, you only need to download the new content and not re-download the content you already have.</li>
<li><b>Put .jar file and .zip files in one directory.</b> <b>Don't</b> unzip the .zip files manually. The game will do it for you and if you don't do it right, the game might not work correctly.</li>
<li><b>Start the game.</b> Open a shell/command prompt, change to the directory where you put the game and type <b><code>&lt;path_to_your_jdk_java_executable&gt; -jar LuckySurvivor-XY.jar</code></b> (replace the LuckySurvivor-XY.jar part with the actual name of your .jar file, of course). Double-clicking on the .jar file might start the game, but some modding features will be missing.</li>
</ol>
If <b>you have trouble getting it up</b> and running, see the <a href="installation_guide.html">installation guide</a> before asking for help.
